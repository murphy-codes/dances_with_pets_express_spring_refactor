# Launch Academy - Week 17 Java Spring Express Refactor Solo Project

We are ready to integrate a React front end with our Spring back end.

We at Launch Academy are big fans of pets. There are many pets out there looking for a home. The goal of this project is to build an app that allows good pets to find their ultimate destination!
